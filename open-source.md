## Open Source Technologies

- **TensorFlow (Google):** The  framework  allows  us  to  develop  neural  networks  (and computationalmodels) using flowgraphs.

- **Keras:** Designed tosimplify the creation of deep learning models. It is written in Python and  can  be  deployed  on  top  of  TensorFlow,  Microsoft  Cognitive  Toolkit  (CNTK)  and Theano.  It  is known for  its  user-friendliness,  modularity  and  ease  of  extensibility.  It supports both convolutional and recurrent networks and runs onCPUs and/orGPUs.

- **Scikit-learn:** It features classification,regressionandclustering models.It is focused on data mining and data analysis. 

- **Microsoft  Cognitive  Toolkit:** It  trains  deep  learning algorithms  and  has  features  that includeoptimized  components  capable  of  handling  data  from  Python,  C++,  ability  to provide efficient resource usage and ease integration with Microsoft Azure.

- **Torch:** It  offers  a  widearray  of  algorithms for  deep  learning.  Provides  with  optimized flexibility and speed.GPU, iOS and Androidsupport.
