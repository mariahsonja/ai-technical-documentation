## Machine Learning Review
  
### Supervised Learning

- **Data:** structured and labelled

- **Techniques:** classification(category) and regression(value)

- **Algorithms**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest (regression and classification)
  - Decision Tree (classification and regression)
  - Support Vectors Machines(SVM – classification)
  - NaïveBayes (classification)

### Unsupervised Learning

- **Data:** not structured or labelled

- **Techniques:** clustering (to discover inherent groups) and association (identify rules).

- **Algorithms**
  - K-means(clustering)
  - Apriori (association)

### Reinforcement Learning

- **Data:** data used to train an agent to learn to make decisions.

- **Techniques:** model-base  RL  (use  experience to  construct  an  internal  model)  and model-free RL (use experienceto learn directly one or both of two simpler quantities without use of a world model.

- **Algorithms**
  - Q-learning
  - SARSA (state-action-reward-state-action)
