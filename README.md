## Deep Learning Review

Deep learning is a term to describe certain types of neural networks and related algorithms that consume  often  very  raw  input  data.  The  process  involves  sending  data  through  many  layers  of nonlinear transformations in order to calculate a target output. Neural networks and deep learning provide the best solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. 

There are multiple types of algorithms:

#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **How it works:** A convolutional neural network consists of an input layer, hidden layers and an output layer. In any feed-forward neural network, any middle layers are  called  hidden  because  their  inputs  and  outputs  are  masked  by  the  activation function and final convolution. 
- **Application:** image processing


#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

- **How it works:** it is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes  form  a directed  graph along  a  temporal  sequence.  This  allows  it  to  exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.
- **Application:** text generation, text summarization, chatbots, translation.

#### Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

- **How it works:** It is a type of recurrent neural networks capable of learning order dependence in sequence  predictions  problems. It  is  well-suited  to  classifying, processing and making predictions based on times series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series.
- **Application:** machine translation,speech recognitionanomaly detection.

#### Other algorithms
- **Stacked Auto-Encoders**
- **Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)**
- **Deep Belief Networks (DBN)**


## Open Source Technologies

- **TensorFlow (Google):** The  framework  allows  us  to  develop  neural  networks  (and computationalmodels) using flowgraphs.

- **Keras:** Designed tosimplify the creation of deep learning models. It is written in Python and  can  be  deployed  on  top  of  TensorFlow,  Microsoft  Cognitive  Toolkit  (CNTK)  and Theano.  It  is known for  its  user-friendliness,  modularity  and  ease  of  extensibility.  It supports both convolutional and recurrent networks and runs onCPUs and/orGPUs.

- **Scikit-learn:** It features classification,regressionandclustering models.It is focused on data mining and data analysis. 

- **Microsoft  Cognitive  Toolkit:** It  trains  deep  learning algorithms  and  has  features  that includeoptimized  components  capable  of  handling  data  from  Python,  C++,  ability  to provide efficient resource usage and ease integration with Microsoft Azure.

- **Torch:** It  offers  a  widearray  of  algorithms for  deep  learning.  Provides  with  optimized flexibility and speed.GPU, iOS and Androidsupport.
