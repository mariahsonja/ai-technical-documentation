### Speech Transcription

#### Algorithms
- **Online sequence-to-sequence:** It produces the output as the input arrives and uses CNN to encode the audios.
- **Sequence-to-sequence:** It makes next steps predictions.
- **Connectionist Temporal Classification:** It is a sequence of data frames with length T: x1, x2, ..., xT, and Y is the output tokens of length L: y1, y2, ..., yL. Because of the way the model is constructed, we require T to be greater than L.


### Text-to-speech

Also knwon as TTS. 

**Open Source**
- **Festival Speech Synthesis System** which uses diphone-based synthesis, as well as more modern and better-sounding techniques.
- **eSpeak** which supports a broad range of languages.
- **Gnuspeech** which uses articulatory synthesisfrom theFree Software Foundation.
