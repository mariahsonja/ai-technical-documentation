Image ProcessingMachines  can  be  taught  to  interpret  and  analyze  images  the  same  way  our  brains  do.  Image Processing involves manipulation of an imagethat amplify the same to generate information out of it. The main goal of Image Processing is to represent processed data in a visual way, improve the processed image quality and classify objects in the image.Methodologies•Analog Image Processing:used for processing photographs, printouts, and other image hard copies.•Digital Image Processing:used for manipulating digital images with the help of complex algorithms.Data •28 x 28 x1 –horizontal pixels, vertical pixels, grayscaleData Processing•Imagedataaugmentationis a technique that can be used to artificially expand the size of a training dataset by creating modified versions ofimagesin the dataset(rotation, width shift, heightshift, brightness,shear, zoom, vertical shift, color scale).Algorithms•Convolutional Neural Networks•Keras Sequential –activation(relu)
